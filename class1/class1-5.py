# Basic for loop with range
for i in range(5):  # range(5) generates numbers from 0 to 4
    print(i)  # Prints numbers from 0 to 4

# For loop with custom start and end values
for i in range(1, 6):  # Generates numbers from 1 to 5
    print(i)  # Prints numbers from 1 to 5

# For loop with start, end, and step values
# range(1, 10, 2) generates numbers from 1 to 9 with a step of 2
for i in range(1, 10, 2):  # Generates numbers from 1 to 9 with a step of 2
    print(i)  # Prints numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
