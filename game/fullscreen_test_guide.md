# Fullscreen Scaling Test Guide

## Test Instructions

1. **Launch the Game**

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Test Windowed Mode**

   - Verify game renders normally in windowed mode
   - Check that all UI elements are positioned correctly
   - Ensure mouse cursor alignment is accurate

3. **Test Fullscreen Toggle**

   - Press **F11** to enter fullscreen mode
   - Verify the game properly fills the entire screen (not just corner)
   - Check that the game content is scaled and centered correctly

4. **Test Fullscreen Functionality**

   - Move mouse around - crosshair should follow accurately
   - Click to shoot - bullets should fire from correct position
   - Use WASD to move - player should move normally
   - Check UI elements (health bar, weapon info) are properly positioned

5. **Test Return to Windowed**
   - Press **F11** again to return to windowed mode
   - Verify everything returns to normal windowed behavior

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Fullscreen Mode Should:

- Fill entire screen with game content
- Scale graphics proportionally to maintain aspect ratio
- Center the game if aspect ratios don't match perfectly
- Maintain accurate mouse input and cursor positioning
- Keep all UI elements properly scaled and positioned

### ❌ Previous Issue (Fixed):

- Game rendering only in corner of screen
- Incorrect mouse input scaling
- UI elements positioned incorrectly

## Technical Details

The fix implements:

- Separate `game_surface` for rendering at native resolution
- Scaling calculations for fullscreen display
- Mouse coordinate transformation for fullscreen input
- Proper centering and scaling of game content

## If Issues Occur

If fullscreen still doesn't work correctly:

1. Check console for any error messages
2. Verify pygame version is 2.0.0 or higher
3. Test on different screen resolutions
4. Report specific behavior (what you see vs what you expect)
